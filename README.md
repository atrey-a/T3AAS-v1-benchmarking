# Benchmarking Air Signature Verifications on T3AAS-v1

Offical PyTorch Implementation of the [IJCB 2023 Paper](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10448666) <i>"Enhancing 3D-Air Signature by Pen Tip Tail Trajectory Awareness: Dataset and Featuring by Novel Spatio-temporal CNN"</i> [<u>[Arxiv]</u>](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.02649)

## Dataset (T3AAS-v1)

Use this [Form](https://forms.gle/AfoyVRtLav8FxsQG7) to request access to the T3AAS-v1 dataset.

## Setup

### Dependencies

Use [`environment.yml`](environment.yml) (with conda) or [`requirements.txt`](requirements.txt) (with pip) to install dependencies.

### Running experiments

All experiments are launched using [`main.py`](main.py). To know the full specification of arguments that can be passed, execute:

```bash
python main.py --help
```

An example script is available in [`run.sh`](run.sh).
